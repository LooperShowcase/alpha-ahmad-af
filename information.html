    Real Madrid, is a Spanish professional football club based in Madrid.
    Founded in 1902 as Madrid Football Club, the club has traditionally worn a
    white home kit since its inception. The honorific title real is Spanish for
    "royal" and was bestowed to the club by King Alfonso XIII in 1920 together
    with the royal crown in the emblem. Real Madrid have played their home
    matches in the 81,044-capacity Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in downtown Madrid
    since 1947. Unlike most European sporting entities, Real Madrid's members
    (socios) have owned and operated the club throughout its history. Real
    Madrid is one of the most widely supported teams internationally.[6] The
    club was estimated to be worth $5.1 billion in 2022, making it the world's
    most valuable football team.[7] In 2021, it was the second highest-earning
    football club in the world, with an annual revenue of €640.7 million.[8]
    Being one of the three founding members of La Liga that have never been
    relegated from the top division since its inception in 1929 (along with
    Athletic Bilbao and Barcelona), Real Madrid holds many long-standing
    rivalries, most notably El Clásico with Barcelona and El Derbi Madrileño
    with Atlético Madrid. The club established itself as a major force in both
    Spanish and European football during the 1950s and 60s, winning five
    consecutive and six overall European Cups and reaching a further two finals.
    This success was replicated on the domestic front, with Madrid winning
    twelve league titles in the span of 16 years. This team, which included
    Alfredo Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Francisco Gento, and Raymond Kopa, is
    considered by some in the sport to be the greatest of all time.[9][10][11]
    In domestic football, the club has won 68 trophies; a record 35 La Liga
    titles, 19 Copa del Rey, 12 Supercopa de España, a Copa Eva Duarte, and a
    Copa de la Liga.[12] In European football, Real Madrid have won a record 21
    trophies;[note 1] a record 14 European Cup/UEFA Champions League titles, two
    UEFA Cups, and a record[note 2] five UEFA Super Cups. In worldwide
    competitions, they have achieved a record seven club world
    championships.[note 3] Real Madrid was recognised as the FIFA Club of the
    20th Century on 11 December 2000 with 42.35% of the vote,[18] and received
    the FIFA Centennial Order of Merit on 20 May 2004.[19] The club was also
    named Best European Club of the 20th Century by the IFFHS on 11 May 2010. In
    June 2017, Madrid succeeded in becoming the first club to win consecutive
    titles in the Champions League era. In May 2022, they won a record-extending
    fourteenth European Cup, making it five titles in the last nine seasons. As
    of May 2022, Real Madrid are ranked fourth behind Bayern Munich, Manchester
    City and Liverpool in the UEFA club rankings.[20]
